## 2024-08-13 - [Focus visibility and ARIA roles for custom filters]
**Learning:** The custom specific sport filter setup and dropdowns didn't have adequate focus states for keyboard navigation, and the ARIA roles needed explicit updates alongside the javascript DOM toggling.
**Action:** Add explicit `:focus-visible` to interactive filter inputs, and use javascript to toggle `aria-expanded` on collapse/expand toggles.
