## 2023-10-28 - Bulk Upserts for Supabase

**Learning:** When dealing with multiple upserts to a Supabase table within a loop, batching them into a single array and using a bulk `upsert` call significantly reduces network overhead and improves performance, especially when avoiding rate limiters designed for external APIs.

**Action:** Whenever iterating through a dataset to insert or update records in a database, aggregate the records into a batch array first and perform a single bulk operation if the database client supports it.
